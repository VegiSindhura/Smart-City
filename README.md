# Smart-City
# 🚀 Real-Time Data Processing System for Smart City Analytics

## 🧠 Overview

This project showcases a scalable and real-time data processing architecture built using **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, and **AWS** services to handle diverse information sources such as vehicle data, GPS, weather, camera feeds, and emergency alerts.

The system is designed for applications like **smart traffic monitoring**, **urban safety**, and **real-time incident response**, enabling visualization through popular BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio.

## 📊 Data Flow Summary

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Data is collected from various real-time sources:
  - 🚗 Vehicle information
  - 📍 GPS location data
  - 📷 Camera surveillance data
  - 🌦️ Weather conditions
  - 🚨 Emergency alerts
- Ingested via **Apache Kafka**, with **Zookeeper** managing cluster coordination.
- Kafka is containerized using **Docker** for portability and scalability.

### 2. **Stream Processing**
- Apache **Spark Streaming** jobs consume Kafka topics and process the incoming data.
- A Spark cluster (Master + Workers) performs transformations and filtering in real-time.

### 3. **Cloud Data Lake (AWS)**
- Processed data is streamed to **Amazon S3**:
  - 🔹 `Raw Storage`: Unfiltered or semi-processed data.
  - 🔹 `Transformed Storage`: Cleaned and formatted data ready for analytics.

### 4. **Data Cataloging and ETL**
- **AWS Glue Crawlers** scan S3 and register metadata in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
- **AWS Glue Jobs** can be used for further transformations, enrichment, and schema management.

### 5. **Data Warehouse**
- Transformed data is loaded into **Amazon Redshift** for fast SQL-based analytics.
- Optionally, **Amazon Athena** can query S3 directly for ad-hoc analytics.

### 6. **Visualization**
- Data from Redshift is connected to BI tools for dashboards and insights:
  - 📊 Power BI
  - 📈 Tableau
  - 🔍 Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio)

## 🔐 Security
- **AWS IAM** is used to control access across all services, ensuring secure data flow and restricted access.
